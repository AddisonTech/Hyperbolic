# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-21)

Replaces the hosted BOPTEST backend with CityLearn, which runs entirely on one machine.

- CityLearn 3.0.2 backend on the official 2023 challenge local evaluation dataset (3 buildings, 719 hourly decisions), shipped in the package so runs and tests need no download and no server.
- Baseline is CityLearn's no-control reference, the one every CityLearn KPI is normalized against. A real full-episode baseline run is committed in `results/baseline`.
- The supervisor decides every hour for all buildings in one call: heat pump, hot water tank and battery.
- Envelope rewritten for the district: action ranges from CityLearn's action space, per-device ramp limits, state of charge limits, a comfort rule at the band edges, and fallback to the baseline action. A test proves the baseline action reproduces the no-control KPIs.
- KPIs come from CityLearn's own `evaluate()`.
- Viewer reworked into the district: building tiles with comfort, storage and grid draw, price on the timeline, cost, emissions and discomfort counters.
- `python -m hyperbolic` entry point; `compare` pairs a new agent run with the committed baseline.
- Fixed the cross-process viewer determinism test on Windows by passing the parent environment through.
- Removed the BOPTEST client, test case definitions, mock simulator and BOPTEST data file.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-21)

First release.

- BOPTEST client for the BOPTEST-Service API: select, scenario, step, advance, forecast, KPI, stop, with retries.
- Baseline runner (stock control, no overwrites) and agent runner (hourly supervisory setpoints) for `multizone_office_simple_air`, on the `typical_heat_day` and `peak_heat_day` scenarios with dynamic electricity pricing.
- Safety envelope in plain code: strict schema validation, equipment ranges, per-step rate limits, comfort band clamps, deadband, and fallback to stock control on any invalid or missing reply. Every clamp and fallback is logged with its reason.
- Model access through `HYPERBOLIC_ANTHROPIC_KEY` with `TRIAGE_ANTHROPIC_KEY` as fallback, Haiku by default and Sonnet by flag, and a hard per-run budget (default 2 USD) checked against the worst case before every call.
- Run folders that record every request, reply, simulator response and decision, and `hyperbolic replay` to reproduce a run with zero API or simulator calls.
- `hyperbolic compare` for the KPI comparison and the viewer data.
- Static replay viewer and scorecard in `docs/`, shipped with a labeled sample from a recorded offline mock run.
- Offline test suite and GitHub Actions CI with an author check.
